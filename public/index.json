We further assume realisations of $\\boldsymbol{Y(x)}$ that are spatially near to each other are correlated. We describe this correlation using a covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$, composed of an (unknown) process variance $\\sigma$ and the correlation matrix $\\boldsymbol{R}$: \\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\left(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\right)=\\sigma^{2} \\boldsymbol{R} \\end{equation} To define the correlation matrix $\\boldsymbol{R}$, \\citet{Jones2001} and many others use the so-called “Kriging” kernel: T﻿he end.
