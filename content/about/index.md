My name is Robert Wenink, and I specialise in the fusion between the fields of Computer Science and Maritime Engineering, possessing a master's degree in both. 

I believe that progress in the maritime industry benefits from a programming skill level that goes beyond what the typical (maritime) engineer is educated for. At the same time, a high-level understanding of the engineering aspects is often required to effectively apply that programming skill in an engineering context. Through optimisation and automation I aim to enable people and companies to focus on what is really important.
