Hi, my name is Robert Wenink. I started the bachelor Marine Technology at the Technical University Delft (Netherlands) and later did a bridging programme in order to do a double masters together with Computer Science. 
For me, it is a beautifull symbiosis as Computer Science provides me with the problem solving and optimization capabilities I long for, with Marine Engineering being the field where in my opinion still lots of opportunities are left on the table for applying the combined knowledge.

Primary interests within Computer Science are (evolutionary) algorithms, Machine/DeepLearning, and High Performance Computing. Within Marine Engineering I have pivoted to fluid simulations (CFD), in which subject I will surely conduct my master's thesis.
How about multi-grid methods enhanced using Machine Learning? How about a laminar flow solver encoded in a lightweight neural network, creating a surrogate CFD model to be used as fitness function in an EA for preliminary design purposes? It surely are some academic and interesting subjects, including skills required for solving a myriad of other real-world problems.
