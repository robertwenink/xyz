## About this website
I specialise in the fusion between the fields of computer science and maritime engineering, possesing a master's degree in both, obtained at the Technical University Delft, Netherlands. I believe that progress in the maritime industry, may it be aiding the energy transition or helping companies focus on subjects that really matter, benefits from a programming skill level that goes beyond that of the average engineer, while a high-level understanding of the engineering aspects is often required to effectively apply that skill. With this in mind I started my own freelance company in 2022 with a most straightforward name: Robert Wenink -
Maritime Engineering & Computer Science. 

- To read more about me, my skills and curriculum vitae, see the [About](/about/) section.
- A project portfolio is found under [Projects](/projects/).
- A (personal) tech blog is maintained in [Blog](/posts/).
