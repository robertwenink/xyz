I specialise in the fusion between the fields of computer science and maritime engineering, possessing a master's degree in both. 

I believe that progress in the maritime industry benefits from a programming skill level that goes beyond what the typical (maritime) engineer is educated for. At the same time, a high-level understanding of the engineering aspects is often required to effectively apply that programming skill in an engineering context. Through optimisation and automation I aim to enable people and companies to focus on what is really important.
<!-- Through -code or process- optimisation and automation, I want to enable others to companies can focus on the subjects that really matter. -->

With this in mind I started my own freelance company in 2022 with a most straightforward name:
</br>Robert Wenink - Maritime Engineering & Computer Science. 

- To read more about me, my skills and curriculum vitae, see the [About](/about/) section.
- A project portfolio is found under [Projects](/projects/).
- A (personal) tech blog is maintained in [Blog](/posts/).
